# Framester

Starting from the third version, we organised Framester in a collection of GitHub repositories. 
Each repositories is dedicated to a resource integrated by Framester and contains: schema, data, metadata and documentation for that resource.
This repository acts as entry point for the collection of repositories and contains the overall Framester schema.
