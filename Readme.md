# Framester

Starting from the third version, we organised Framester in a collection of GitHub repositories. Each repository is dedicated to a linguistic resource integrated by Framester and it contains schema, data, metadata and documentation for that resource. This repository acts as entry point for the collection of repositories and it contains the overall Framester schema.
